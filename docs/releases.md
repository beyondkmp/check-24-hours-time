of the form `releases/x.x.x`

## Publishing to NPM

Releases are done to NPM, and are currently limited to the core team.

```sh
# to ensure everything is up-to-date and tests pass
yarn build
yarn test

# you might need to do a different sort of version bump here
npm version minor

# this will also run the test suite and fail if any errors found
# this will also run `git push --follow-tags` at the end
npm publish
```
