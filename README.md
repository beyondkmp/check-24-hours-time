Read the
[Setup](https://github.com/beyondkmp/check-24-hours-time/blob/master/docs/index.md#setup)
section to ensure your development environment is setup for what you need.

While we always try to accomodate requests this package is mainly developed to
support GitHub Desktop and our priorities reflect that.

If you want to see something supported, open an issue to start a discussion
